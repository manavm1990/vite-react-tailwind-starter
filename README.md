# Vite ➕ React ➕ Tailwind Starter

## TLDR

`npm i` to install all devDependencies (includes ESLint and Prettier). `npm start` to start the app.

## What's Included

- ESLint using AirBnB style guide, integrated with Prettier for formatting.
- VS Code extensions and settings to make it all work seamlessly in VS Code.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Extensions

In addition to ESLint and Prettier:

- [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) for...better comments.
- [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).

### Settings

You should browse and look up the settings (or ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoCodeFinity)). Generally, as soon as you leave the file, it:

- Automatically saves (no need to save manually).
- Automatically formats your code.
- Automatically lints your code.
- Cleans up imports. This includes removing unused imports and sorting them alphabetically. If an import is removed prematurely, just do an undo and they will come right back.
